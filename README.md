# Eduardo's README

This is a brief introduction about myself. I am a Mechatronics Engineer ⚙️🔌 from the University of Brasília UnB (University of Brasília - 🇧🇷 - MSc. Mechatronics Systems). I am a current MSc. Mechatronics Systems at the UnB, but just got admitted at the KTH (Royal Institute of Technology - 🇸🇪- in MSc. Engineering Design). In this file, I will try to show you my projects, my awards, and a little bit about my hobbies.

As a recently graduated Engineer, I do not yet have much experience, but, as my Final Work in Mechatronics Engineering, I built a bending machine, capable of bending thin metal sheets. This device could serve to perform tests in metals, serving as a ludic-pedagogic device, that can be used by professors and academics that want to perform bent plates. Since it is a pedagogic device, perhaps in the future, students start to use it as a device in classes.

## Hi, I'm Eduardo, a MSc. Mechatronics Systems at the University of Brasília and this is a test to my Github account.

* Thank you for your time and patience yet.
