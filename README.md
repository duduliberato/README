As a recently graduated Engineer, I do not yet have much experience, but, as my Final Work in Mechatronics Engineering, I built a bending machine, capable of bending thin metal sheets. This device could serve to perform tests in metals, serving as a ludic-pedagogic device, that can be used by professors and academics that want to perform better 

## Hi, I'm Eduardo, a MSc. Mechatronics Systems at the University of Brasília and this is a test to my Github account.

* Thank you for your time and patience yet.
